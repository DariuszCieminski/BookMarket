# Book Market
The purpose of this application is to catalog all your books in one place and create a handy library. If you want to do away books you don't need, you can mark them as to be sold, set the price you want to sell them for, and wait for other people to make an offer to buy them. After you accept someone's offer, you can agree with each other how the transaction will be made, by using private messages.
The application is available [HERE](https://bookmarket-pl.herokuapp.com/).

The application was made using Spring Boot and uses following technologies:
 1. Spring Security
 2. Hibernate
 3. Thymeleaf
 4. Javascript with jQuery
